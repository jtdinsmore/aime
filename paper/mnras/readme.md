This is the final submitted version of Jack Dinsmore's and Julien de Wit's paper "Constraining the Interiors of Asteroids Through Close Encounters."

Minimal changes were necessary (fixing hyperlinks, removing a comma typo)

Latex files for both the main paper and the supplemental data are provided in this compressed file, as are the figures for the main paper (`figs` directory) and the MP4s for the supplemental material (`movies` directory).

The material to be published (the two PDFs and the MP4s) was also submitted in the online portal.

Best,
Jack Dinsmore
