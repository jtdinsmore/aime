We simulate the dynamics of components in well-characterized binary and triple near-Earth asteroid systems and use surface of section plots to map the possible spin configurations of the satellites. For asynchronous satellites, the analysis reveals large regions of phase space where the spin state of the satellite is chaotic. For synchronous satellites, we show that libration amplitudes can reach detectable values even for moderately elongated shapes. The presence of chaotic regions in the phase space has important consequences for the evolution of binary asteroids. It may substantially increase spin synchronization timescales, explain the observed fraction of asychronous binaries, delay BYORP-type evolution, and extend the lifetime of binaries. The variations in spin rate due to large librations also affect the analysis and interpretation of light curve and radar observations.}

abstract = {On February 15, 2013 asteroid (367943) Duende, provisionally named 2012 DA14, experienced an extremely close earth encounter, passing within 27,700 km altitude. An observation campaign was made possible by one year's notice of the flyby. This campaign, discussed in detail in the companion paper by Moskovitz et al. (2019), yielded visible-wavelength photometry before and after closest approach. Post-flyby Goldstone Doppler-delay radar data were also obtained. These data indicated a roughly 40 m × 20 m object in non-principal axis rotation. Leveraging light curve frequency analysis from the Moskovitz et al. companion paper, dynamical and inertia constraints from the rough radar-derived elongations, and simulated photometry, only two post-flyby states were deemed viable. These were a long axis mode (LAM) with long axis convention periods Pϕ¯=6.36 h and Pψ = 8.73 h and a short axis mode (SAM) with Pϕ¯=8.71 h and Pψ = 23.7 h (each with nominal long-intermediate and long-short ellipsoid axis ratios of 1.7:1 and 2.3:1 respectively). The SAM solution was more consistent with the post-flyby photometry and radar data. Nevertheless, there were differences between the amplitude and phase of the post-flyby and best-fit simulated SAM light curves at some epochs. These discrepancies may be due to a non-ellipsoidal shape, non-uniform albedo, and/or incorrect spin state solution (attitude, inertias, tumbling periods, or rotation mode). Analysis of the sparse pre-flyby photometry by Moskovitz et al. yielded poor Fourier series solutions for all principal axis states and different peaks in the pre and post-flyby WindowCLEAN power spectra. This suggests the asteroid was tumbling before the encounter and that its spin state changed. Propagating the best-fitting LAM and SAM solutions backwards through the flyby with terrestrial tidal torques resulted in significant dispersion of the rotation states. The pre-flyby SAM states coincided with the notable Moskovitz et al. Fourier solution P1 = 8.37 h and P2 = 24.2 h. Overall, we propose Duende was tumbling before the 2013 flyby and that its spin state may have changed during the flyby. Furthermore, our analysis suggests Duende is currently in SAM with Pϕ¯=8.71 h and Pψ = 23.7 h with pole J2000 ecliptic longitude and obliquity of roughly 70° and 95° or 245° and 90° respectively. The spin state characterization approach outlined in this paper could be used for future analyses with inertia, dynamical, and observational constraints.}

abstract = {On 15 February 2013, the asteroid 367943 Duende (2012 DA14) experienced a near-Earth encounter at an altitude of 27,700 km or 4.2 Earth radii. We present here the results of an extensive, multi-observatory campaign designed to probe for spectral and/or rotational changes to Duende due to gravitational interactions with the Earth during the flyby. Our spectral data reveal no changes within systematic uncertainties. Post-flyby lightcurve photometry places strong constraints on the rotation state of Duende, showing that it is in non-principal axis rotation with fundamental periods of P1 = 8.71 ± 0.03 and P2 = 23.7 ± 0.2 h. Multiple lightcurve analysis techniques, coupled with theoretical considerations and delay-Doppler radar imaging, allow us to assign these periods to specific rotational axes of the body. In particular we suggest that Duende is now in a non-principal, short axis mode rotation state with a precessional period equal to P1 and oscillation about the symmetry axis at a rate equal to P2. Temporal and signal-to-noise limitations inherent to the pre-flyby photometric dataset make it difficult to definitively diagnose whether these periods represent a change imparted due to gravitational torques during the flyby. However, based on multiple analysis techniques and a number of plausibility arguments, we suggest that Duende experienced a rotational change during the planetary encounter with an increase in its precessional rotation period. Our preferred interpretation of the available data is that the precession rate increased from 8.4 h prior to the flyby to 8.7 h afterwards. A companion paper by Benson et al. (2019) provides a more detailed dynamical analysis of this event and compares the data to synthetic lightcurves computed from a simple shape model of Duende. The interpretation and results presented in these two works are consistent with one another. The ultimate outcome of this campaign suggests that the analytic tools we employed are sufficient to extract detailed information about solid-body rotation states given data of high enough quality and temporal sampling. As current and future discovery surveys find more near-Earth asteroids, the opportunities to monitor for physical changes during planetary encounters will increase.}

They are valid for rigid bodies with arbitrary shapes and mass distributions. By using recursive relations, these formulae can be easily implemented on computers. Comparisons with previous studies show their superiority in computation speed. Using the algorithm as a tool, the planar problem of two ellipsoids is studied. Generally, potential truncated at the second order is good enough for a qualitative description of the mutual dynamics. However, for ellipsoids with very large non-spherical terms, higher order terms of the potential should be considered, at the cost of a higher computational cost. Explicit formulae of the potential truncated to the fourth order are given.},

The relative equilibria have been previously studied analytically and general motions were numerically analyzed using some expansion of the gravitational potential up to the second order, but only when there are no direct interactions between the orientation of the bodies. Here we expand the potential up to the fourth order and we show that the secular problem obtained after averaging over fast angles, as for the precession model of Boué and Laskar [Boué, G., Laskar, J., 2006. Icarus 185, 312–330], is integrable, but not trivially. We describe the general features of the motions and we provide explicit analytical approximations for the solutions. We demonstrate that the general solution of the secular system can be decomposed as a uniform precession around the total angular momentum and a periodic symmetric orbit in the precessing frame. More generally, we show that for a general n-body system of rigid bodies in gravitational interaction, the regular quasiperiodic solutions can be decomposed into a uniform precession around the total angular momentum, and a quasiperiodic motion with one frequency less in the precessing frame.}

abstract = {We demonstrate that mutual gravitational interactions between an asteroid and a planet or another asteroid can play an important role in shaping an asteroid's spin state. We focus on two situations that asteroids may encounter during their lifetimes. The first is the environment after creation from a disrupted parent asteroid, when there may be many asteroid fragments interacting gravitationally with each other before their mutual escape. The other is the interaction between an asteroid and a planet during a hyperbolic flyby. In each case the mutual gravitational interaction can alter the asteroid's spin state. We derive analytical descriptions of the effects and perform numerical simulations to explore the interactions and to give examples. The net effect of many small interactions, taken in isolation, is to cause the asteroid to spin at a faster rate—although this must be balanced against all other effects that influence spin rates. Conversely, the effect of a single, strong interaction can fundamentally change an asteroid's spin state, causing it to tumble and significantly increasing or decreasing its overall angular momentum. We simulate interactions of a sphere of arbitrary mass with Toutatis and find that these types of gravitational interactions can provide partial explanations for the current Toutatis rotational state.}

In this note, we present a tutorial review of the theory of the Moore--Penrose pseudoinverse. We present the first definitions and some motivations, and after obtaining some basic results, we center our discussion on the spectral theorem and present an algorithmically simple expression for the computation of the Moore--Penrose pseudoinverse of a given matrix.

abstract = {We publish a set of 16 light curves of mutual events inside the synchronous system of the Jupiter Trojan (617) Patroclus. Patroclus is th only binary system of the six target asteroids of the forthcoming NASA Discovery-class mission Lucy. Determining the physical parameters of the system is therefore of primary importance in helping to plan the flyby mission. Light curves were acquired during two follow-up campaigns of 6 months each between January–June 2007 and July–December 2012. Eight small eclipse events of amplitude of 0.2–0.3 mag were recorded in 2007. On the other hand, in 2012, the amplitudes of the phenomena were much deeper, between 0.6 and 0.8 mag, due to a nearly edge-on configuration of the system. We refined the sidereal period to 102.78624 ± 0.00015h = 4.282760 ± 0.000005days. The J2000 ecliptic coordinates of the pole of the system were found to be λ = 235.3 ± 1.2° andβ =  − 62.4 ± 0.2°. The volume ratio was determined equal to q = 0.69 ± 0.08. By using a model of inhomogeneous Roche ellipsoids in hydrostatic equilibrium, we derived a bulk density of 0.81 ± 0.16g/cm3 and a surface grain density of 2.69 ± 0.36g/cm3 in agreement with spectroscopic observations of this P-type asteroid. As a validation, our solution was applied to revisit recent results obtained from observations of another type: AO astrometry and stellar occultation. Our model is thus perfectly able to account for these observations after fitting the mutual separation to the value of 695 ± 10km. Consequently, the area-equivalent diameter of the system as a whole is derived DΑ = 168.8 ± 2.6km.}

abstract = {Near-Earth Asteroid 99942 Apophis presents a unique opportunity to study the dynamics, bulk properties, and interior structure of a rubble-pile asteroid when it makes its close encounter with the Earth in 2029. In order to better understand the potential outcomes of a tidal encounter between Earth and Apophis, and to support a potential future mission to Apophis, we perform numerical simulations of the encounter. We represent Earth as a single rigid sphere and the target body as a cohesionless, self-gravitating granular aggregate of identical spheres in a hexagonal-close-packed configuration subject only to gravitational and soft-sphere (elastic) contact forces. We use a radar-derived shape model for the asteroid, along with current best estimates for the orbital solution of Apophis to simulate the encounter trajectory, and perform a large parameter sweep over different potential encounter orientations and bulk densities for the body. We find that the median change in the rotational period for Apophis, sampled for a range of different initial body and spin orientations, is −1.9 h (mean −0.1 ± 6.0 (1-σ) hours) during the encounter. Additionally, we measure that the mean of the largest change in axis length among the 3 primary body axes, also sampled over trials with different initial body and spin orientations, is 0.132 ± 0.066 mm during the encounter, assuming a bulk Young's Modulus of 106 Pa. Such strains on the timescale of peak stress during the encounter may be large enough to be detected by an in-situ seismometer.}

abstract = {Our photometric observations of Asteroid (99942) Apophis from December 2012 to April 2013 revealed it to be in a state of non-principal axis rotation (tumbling). We constructed its spin and shape model and found that it is in a moderately excited Short Axis Mode (SAM) state with a ratio of the rotational kinetic energy to the basic spin state energy E/E0=1.024±0.013. (All quoted uncertainties correspond to 3σ.) The greatest and intermediate principal moments of inertia are nearly the same with I2/I3=0.965-0.015+0.009, but the smallest principal moment of inertia is substantially lower with I1/I3=0.61-0.08+0.11; the asteroid’s dynamically equivalent ellipsoid is close to a prolate ellipsoid. The precession and rotation periods are Pϕ=27.38±0.07h and Pψ=263±6h, respectively; the strongest observed lightcurve amplitude for the SAM case is in the 2nd harmonic of P1=Pϕ-1-Pψ-1-1=30.56±0.01h. The rotation is retrograde with the angular momentum vector’s ecliptic longitude and latitude of 250° and -75° (the uncertainty area is approximately an ellipse with the major and minor semiaxes of 27° and 14°, respectively). An implication of the retrograde rotation is a somewhat increased probability of the Apophis’ impact in 2068, but it is still very small with the risk level on the Palermo Scale remaining well below zero. Apophis is a member of the population of slowly tumbling asteroids. Applying the theory of asteroid nutational damping by Breiter et al. (Breiter, S., Rożek, A., Vokrouhlický, D. [2012]. Mon. Not. R. Astron. Soc. 427, 755–769), we found that slowly tumbling asteroids predominate in the spin rate–size range where their estimated damping times are greater than about 0.2Gyr. The appearance that the PA/NPA rotators transition line seems to follow a line of constant damping time may be because there are two or more asteroid spin evolution mechanisms in play, or the factor of μQ (the elastic modulus times the quality factor) is not constant but it may decrease with decreasing asteroid size, which would oppose the trend due to decreasing collisional age or excitation time.}

    abstract = "{In 2018 December, the main-belt asteroid (6478) Gault was reported to display activity. Gault is an asteroid belonging to the Phocaea dynamical family and was not previously known to be active, nor was any other member of the Phocaea family. In this work, we present the results of photometric and spectroscopic observations that commenced soon after the discovery of activity. We obtained observations over two apparitions to monitor its activity, rotation period, composition, and possible non-gravitational orbital evolution. We find that Gault has a rotation period of P = 2.4929 ± 0.0003 h with a light-curve amplitude of 0.06 magnitude. This short rotation period close to the spin barrier limit is consistent with Gault having a density no smaller than ρ = 1.85 g cm−3 and its activity being triggered by the YORP (Yarkovsky–O’Keefe–Radzievskii–Paddack) spin-up mechanism. Analysis of the Gault phase curve over phase angles ranging from 0.4° to 23.6° provides an absolute magnitude of H = 14.81 ± 0.04, G1 = 0.25 ± 0.07, and G2 = 0.38 ± 0.04. Model fits to the phase curve find the surface regolith grain size constrained between 100 and 500 \\$\\rm \\{\\mu \\}\\$m. Using relations between the phase curve and albedo, we determine that the geometrical albedo of Gault is pv = 0.26 ± 0.05 corresponding to an equivalent diameter of \\$D = 2.8^\\{+0.4\\}\_\\{-0.2\\}\\$ km. Our spectroscopic observations are all consistent with an ordinary chondrite-like composition (S, or Q-type in the Bus-DeMeo taxonomic classification). A search through archival photographic plate surveys found previously unidentified detections of Gault dating back to 1957 and 1958. Only the latter had been digitized, which we measured to nearly double the observation arc of Gault. Finally, we did not find any signal of activity during the 2020 apparition or non-gravitational effects on its orbit.}",

abstract = {We present results of numerical simulations that show that Earth's tidal forces can both distort and disrupt Earth-crossing asteroids that have weak “rubble-pile” structures. Building on previous studies, we consider more realistic asteroid shapes and trajectories, test a variety of spin rates and axis orientations, and employ a dissipation algorithm to treat more accurately collisions between the particles that make up the model asteroid. We explore a large parameter space, including the asteroid's periapseq, encounter velocity with the Earthv∞, spin periodP, initial spin axis orientation, and body orientation at periapse. We parameterize the simulation outcomes by the amount of mass stripped from the asteroid during a flyby. Our most severe disruptions result in fragment trains similar in character to the “string of pearls” created when Comet D/Shoemaker-Levy 9 was disrupted near Jupiter in 1992. Less catastrophic disruptions cause material to be stripped off in more isotropic fashion, leaving a central remnant with a characteristic distorted shape. Some ejecta can enter into stable orbits around the remnant, creating a binary or multiple system. Even when no mass is lost tidal forces and torques can modify the asteroid's shape and spin. Our results show that mass loss is enhanced for small values ofq,v∞, andP, and depends to a certain extent on the body's initial spin orientation (for example, retrograde rotation reduces mass loss). An elongated asteroid was found to be far easier to disrupt than a spherical one, though the orientation of the ellipsoid at periapse can noticeably change the outcome. The size and orbital distribution of the ejecta are discussed, along with the applications of this technique towards an understanding of doublet craters, crater chains, and asteroids with peculiar shapes and spins.}

abstract = {Impact-induced seismic vibrations have long been suspected of being an important surface modification process on small satellites and asteroids. In this study, we use a series of linked seismic and geomorphic models to investigate the process in detail. We begin by developing a basic theory for the propagation of seismic energy in a highly fractured asteroid, and we use this theory to model the global vibrations experienced on the surface of an asteroid following an impact. These synthetic seismograms are then applied to a model of regolith resting on a slope, and the resulting downslope motion is computed for a full range of impactor sizes. Next, this computed downslope regolith flow is used in a morphological model of impact crater degradation and erasure, showing how topographic erosion accumulates as a function of time and the number of impacts. Finally, these results are applied in a stochastic cratering model for the surface of an Eros-like body (same volume and surface area as the asteroid), with craters formed by impacts and then erased by the effects of superposing craters, ejecta coverage, and seismic shakedown. This simulation shows good agreement with the observed 433 Eros cratering record at a Main Belt exposure age of 400±200 Myr, including the observed paucity of small craters. The lowered equilibrium numbers (loss rate=production rate) for craters less than ~100 m in diameter is a direct result of seismic erasure, which requires less than a meter of mobilized regolith to reproduce the NEAR observations. This study also points to an upper limit on asteroid size for experiencing global, surface-modifying, seismic effects from individual impacts of about 70-100 km (depending upon asteroid seismic properties). Larger asteroids will experience only localized (regional) seismic effects from individual impacts.}
