# Fit

This code generates data for a specific asteroid parameterization, then fits to it with an MCMC. It works by wrapping the C++ simulation code found in `../sim` with `main.cpp` in this directory, then compiles it with `fast-build` to the `.so` found here. The python module `pybind` allows the `.so` to be loaded and called by python, so that we use the `emcee` module to do the fit.

All units are given in SI units unless otherwise specified.

## Use
Simply run `python fit.py <params>`, where `<params>` is your params file. If you want to run multiple fits, put your params in the `staged` directory in the root of your project and run `python submit.py` on Supercloud.

## Uncertainty models

I have four uncertainty models at the moment, increasing order of complexity.

1. a constant increase to all components of spin vector
2. a constant factor increase to all components of spin vector
3. a random rotation of each spin vector
4. a random rotation of each spin vector by a distance-dependent angle. This option is unfinished because it has one additional parameter: how the angle depends on distance. I have not figured out how to fix this parameter.

## To do

The current challenge is that the minimizer no longer finds perfect redchis of 1.0 all the time. The MCMC does, but then it doesn't have enough time to make good probability distributions.
* The algorithm should be tweaked to fix this, but not too much; it works for the test model.
* The solution may be to adjust the distance ratio cut for the l=2 minimization
* I might also use my own minimizer.
