## Jun 2

I started extraction of uncertainties as a function of observational precision. Division of 49 m.

## June 3

I killed the process and switched to 99 m. It was taking too long. (2 hours per task). I'm running all scans now.

## June 6

I edited the code so that it would not do reruns of data already generated, and would not kill itself when it hit a failed run. Pulled some of the scans.

I also realized that the output is pure uncertainty, not uncertainty ratio. So I changed it to uncertainty ratio.

After my meeting with Julien, I changed the prior to 0.25-3 and adjusted the number of finite elements used. Then I ran all of these on the SC.

## June 8

I finished the DOF scan and found that fewer DOFs leads to less uncertainty, not more. Now I'm rerunning with only a few DOFs, averaging over many runs, and booting all those that fail. This is being parallelized.

## June 9

A couple of the scans with full DOF completed and showed good sensitivity.

I fixed some issues I was having with dof-scan by making it write to new files. Instead of being named `ast-*`, they're named `cast-*` (the `c` stands for coarse). Similarly, the results are stored in an npy file beginning with a c. That's three lines of code. I must change them back if I unify dof-scan and dof-scan-precise eventually.

THIS ALSO MEANS THAT FOR A FEW MINUTES, DOF-SCAN AND DOF-SCAN-PRECISE WERE WRITING TO THE SAME H5 FILE. THIS COULD CORRUPT MY DATA.

## June 13

DOF scan completed. It looks great. 2 DOF failed because it's so few.

## June 21

Changed so that the average density is computed instead.

## June 22

Restarted thresholds to pull everything from the samples rather than the average position.

## June 27

Finished DOF scan. Everything is roughly as I had expected, given previous data.
